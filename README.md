# ART - Adaptive Radix Trie

A high-performance, **thread-safe** Go implementation of the Adaptive Radix Trie (ART) data structure with optimistic concurrency control. This implementation provides excellent performance characteristics for concurrent string-based key-value storage with adaptive node compression and efficient memory usage.

## Overview

This implementation is based on the research paper "The Adaptive Radix Tree: ARTful Indexing for Main-Memory Databases" by Viktor Leis et al., with additional concurrency control techniques inspired by optimistic locking protocols. The ART data structure provides excellent performance characteristics for string-based key-value storage with adaptive node compression and efficient memory usage.

## Key Features

### Core ART Features
- **Adaptive Node Types**: Automatically grows from small to large node types based on the number of children
    - Node4: Up to 4 children (linear search)
    - Node16: Up to 16 children (linear search, SIMD-ready)
    - Node48: Up to 48 children (array indexing)
    - Node256: Up to 256 children (direct indexing)
- **Path Compression**: Eliminates single-child nodes by storing common prefixes
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory layout for cache performance
- **Generic Value Storage**: Store any type of value with byte slice keys

### Concurrency Features
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Full concurrent read/write support
- **Optimistic Locking**: Lock-free reads with minimal write contention
- **Restart-Based Consistency**: Automatic retry mechanism for consistency
- **Lock-Free Searches**: Multiple readers can search simultaneously
- **Adaptive Write Locking**: Minimal locking only when structural changes occur
- **Memory Ordering**: Proper atomic operations for cross-thread visibility

## Performance Benchmarks

Recent benchmarks on AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (12 cores):

### Single-Threaded Performance

- **Memory Pressure**: Maintains performance across dataset sizes (1K→1M keys)
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling up to 16 threads (23.8M ops/sec)

## Concurrency Architecture

### Optimistic Locking Protocol
```
Read Path (Lock-Free):
1. Read version + validate not locked/obsolete
2. Perform tree traversal
3. Validate version unchanged
4. Restart if validation fails

Write Path (Minimal Locking):
1. Traverse to insertion point (optimistic)
2. Acquire write lock only for structural changes  
3. Perform modification
4. Increment version + release lock
```

### Version-Lock-Obsolete Bits
- **62-bit Version**: Monotonic counter for consistency
- **1-bit Lock**: Indicates ongoing write operation
- **1-bit Obsolete**: Marks nodes for garbage collection

### Node Growth Strategy
- Nodes automatically grow when full: Node4→Node16→Node48→Node256
- Growth operations are atomic with proper locking
- Old nodes marked obsolete after successful growth

## API Reference

### Tree

#### `NewART() Tree`
Creates a new empty thread-safe ART instance.

#### `Insert(key []byte, val interface{})`
Thread-safe insertion of a key-value pair. If the key already exists, the value will be updated atomically.

**Parameters:**
- `key`: The byte slice key to insert
- `val`: The value to associate with the key (can be any type)

**Concurrency**: Safe for concurrent use. Multiple goroutines can insert simultaneously.

#### `Search(key []byte) (interface{}, bool)`
Thread-safe search for a key in the tree.

**Parameters:**
- `key`: The byte slice key to search for

**Returns:**
- `interface{}`: The value associated with the key (nil if not found)
- `bool`: True if the key was found, false otherwise

**Concurrency**: Lock-free reads. Multiple goroutines can search simultaneously without blocking.

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new thread-safe ART
    t := NewART()
    
    // Insert key-value pairs (thread-safe)
    t.Insert([]byte("foo"), 1)
    t.Insert([]byte("far"), 2) 
    t.Insert([]byte("fooz"), 3)
    t.Insert([]byte("faz"), 4)
    
    // Search for values (lock-free)
    value, found := t.Search([]byte("far"))
    if found {
        fmt.Printf("Found: %v\n", value) // Output: Found: 2
    }
    
    // Concurrent usage example
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
            key := fmt.Sprintf("concurrent_%d", i)
            t.Insert([]byte(key), i)
        }
    }()
    
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
            key := fmt.Sprintf("concurrent_%d", i)
            t.Search([]byte(key))
        }
    }()
}
```

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Node Types & Adaptive Growth

The ART uses four different node types that adapt based on the number of children:

1. **Node4**: Stores up to 4 children using linear arrays
2. **Node16**: Stores up to 16 children using linear arrays (SIMD-optimizable)
3. **Node48**: Stores up to 48 children using an index array for O(1) lookup
4. **Node256**: Stores up to 256 children with direct array indexing

### Path Compression

The implementation uses path compression to reduce memory usage and improve cache performance by storing common prefixes directly in nodes rather than creating chains of single-child nodes.

### Concurrency Control Details

**Lock-Free Reads**: Search operations never acquire locks, using versioning to detect concurrent modifications.

**Optimistic Writes**: Insert operations traverse optimistically and only lock when structural changes are needed.

**Restart Mechanism**: When version validation fails, operations automatically restart from the root.

**Memory Ordering**: All atomic operations use proper memory barriers for cross-CPU consistency.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Search**: O(k) where k is the key length (lock-free)
- **Insert**: O(k) where k is the key length (minimal locking)
- **Space**: Adaptive based on data distribution
- **Concurrency**: Excellent scaling for read-heavy workloads
- **Cache-friendly**: Optimized memory layout for modern CPUs

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose ART When:
- **High Concurrency**: Need thread-safe data structure with good scaling
